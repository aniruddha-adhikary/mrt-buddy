                    MRT Buddy is designed to help you manage your transit
                    experience by scanning your Dhaka MRT Pass or RapidPass. The
                    app is fully compatible with both card types and displays
                    your current card balance and shows you your last 10
                    transactions, making it easy to track your transit usage.

                    How does the app handle my data? Is it secure?

                  <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-50">
                    Your privacy is our top priority. MRT Buddy operates
                    completely offline and only extracts data directly from your
                    card to display it to you. The last 20 trip details are
                    stored directly on your card itself - your card is like a
                    small computer that is powered by the NFC reader. The app
                    simply reads this data when you scan your card. No servers
                    are involved, and no data is stored elsewhere. You own your
                    data, which stays securely in your wallet on your card.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-50 mt-2">
                    The app can only read your card data when you physically
                    have the card in your possession - just like checking your
                    balance at an MRT station kiosk.

                    Does the app have API access to the Dhaka MRT System?

                  <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-50">
                    No, we don't have or need direct API access to the Dhaka MRT
                    System. The Bangladeshi MRT Card uses sophisticated Japanese
                    transit system technology, specifically Sony FeliCa cards.
                    These cards are designed to store your last 10 transactions
                    directly on the card itself. We calculate your balance by
                    reading this stored transaction data from your card.

                    Is the app secure? Can it modify my card balance?
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-50">
                    The app is completely secure and cannot modify your card
                    balance. The MRT cards use advanced FeliCa chip technology
                    with military-grade security features. The system implements
                    strict security measures that make tampering mathematically
                    impossible:
                  </p>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-2 space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-50">
                    <li>
                      The card uses cryptographic signatures that require secret
                      keys held exclusively by DMTCL (Dhaka Mass Transit Company
                      Limited)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Even if someone could write data to the card, the
                      cryptographic signatures would not match, making the card
                      invalid
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Personal information like cardholder details are stored
                      only on DMTCL's secure servers, not on the card itself
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The app can only read basic transaction data - it cannot
                      access any personal information or modify any card data
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                    While the app stores your transaction history locally on
                    your device to enhance your experience, we recommend
                    securing your device to prevent unauthorized access to this
                    data.

                  <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-50">
                    Unfortunately no. This feature would need to be implemented
                    by the Metro Rail Authority themselves, or by a company
                    licensed by them. Third-party apps cannot implement this
                    functionality due to the security measures in place.

                  <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-50">
                    Unfortunately, check-in and check-out functionality using
                    phones can only be implemented with direct cooperation from
                    the Metro Rail authorities. This requires special
                    integration with their systems and security protocols that
                    are not available to third-party applications.

                    No, card top-ups can only be done at official MRT stations
                    or authorized points. This is because:

                    <li>
                      Writing to the card requires special encryption keys held

                    <li>
                      The card's secure blocks are encrypted and do not allow
                      unauthorized modifications

                    <li>
                      E-wallet or digital payment integration would require

                  <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-50">
                    No, NFC (Near Field Communication) is required to
                    communicate with your Metro card. Without NFC hardware in
                    your phone, the app cannot read the card data. This is a
                    hardware limitation that cannot be worked around with
                    software.
